<!--
The CSS properties display: flex; and justify-content: center; are used together to center content within a container. Here's a breakdown of what each property does:

display: flex;: This property turns the container into a flexbox, enabling a more advanced and flexible layout model. Flexbox is great for distributing space along a single axis (either horizontally or vertically) and for aligning items within a container.

justify-content: center;: This property aligns the flex items (the direct children of the container) along the main axis (typically horizontal) and centers them within the container. When combined with display: flex;, it centers the content horizontally.

Example Usage
html
Copy code
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; height: 100px; background-color: lightgray;">
    <p>This content is centered horizontally.</p>
</div>
In this example, the <p> element will be centered horizontally within the <div> container. The container itself is styled with a height and a background color to make the centering effect more visible.

Additional Flexbox Properties
align-items: center;: Centers the items vertically within the container.
flex-direction: row;: Arranges items in a row (default) or column (flex-direction: column;).
flex-wrap: wrap;: Allows items to wrap onto multiple lines if there's not enough space on one line.
